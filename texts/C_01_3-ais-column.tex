    \ParallelRText{My parents went to the bush. They stayed in the bush and looked for game. My father shot four big animals, two cassowaries and two boars. Then he shot three ground kangaroos and five tree kangaroos. That's enough, he didn't shoot any more animals. They put the meat on planks. They put the planks side by side and lit fires underneath the planks. The meat became dry. Part of it they cut with a sharp cassowary bone for their bush meals. The other meat they cut with the cassowary bone to take it home to the village. The sorcerers heard something: ``The two stay in the bush. Apai is staying in the bush.'' The sorcerers went there. From a higher spot they looked down to him. Then they left the place.}

    \ParallelRText{Later the sorcerers came back. They killed him at the river, when he was bathing. My mother didn't see him ensorcelled. They killed him secretly. Then the sorcerers rouse him by means of the blood of a dead human. He stood up. My father got up and went back to the bush hut. He stayed on there. For one week he remained in the bush hut. Then he became sick. He was very sick. Sîp, a man from Ninggera, thought: ``He will die soon. I will go together with him to Ninggera by canoe.'' One night he stayed in Ninggera until daybreak. In the morning he picked him up by canoe. With my father in the canoe, he paddled through the mangrove swamp. They arrived in Ninggera. He left the canoe and walked with him on his shoulders. Sîp brought him to his house and left my father there. Then he went and looked for a car. He met my uncle and told him: ``Margaret's father is sick. He is very sick and he may die.'' A car came from Vanimo. The car went along the mangrove swamp. They picked them all up, my father, my mother, and my brother. Together they came to Pasi.}

    \ParallelRText{All rested. Op, Margaret's uncle, smell\-ed his mouth and said to them: ``Some sorcerers went down killing him. He may die. All of you go together to the village.'' They brought him by car. He shouldn't die on the road. The sick man rose again a bit, and they gave him water to drink. They drove him to his house. There they put him down from the car and went together to his house. There they bedded him on his bed. During the night he dies. Somebody said: ``Tell his daughter that her father has died.'' When they came to me, I told them: ``The river has risen and I have a baby. I will come in the morning by canoe. I'll cross the river by canoe.'' I cried. I cried desperately. The people dug a hole and got a coffin ready. They were making it. Then they lifted him together with the mat\-ress and put him down into the coffin. Now they carried him to the burial place, shut the lid of the coffin, and let it down into the hole. They covered the hole and put sticks together as a small fence. They covered it. It's covered properly. So they went back to their houses.}
