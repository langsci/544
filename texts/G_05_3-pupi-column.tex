    \ParallelRText{I hear the wind being there. Then the wind is quiet. I hear the wind, it is there. Now the wind has stopped. The wind comes, then pauses. The wind comes again and is quiet again. It comes and goes. The wind comes from the mountains. Only wind, no rain. The wind takes the rain away. The wind lets your hair fly. The wind lets fly the leaves of the trees.}
