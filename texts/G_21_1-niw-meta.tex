The text \textit{Nini na wîs} `Sun and Moon' is a song sung by Margaret Osi in Ossima village in January 2000.

The oral tradition of texts recited to an audience is complemented here by sung texts. The spectrum of singing is quite limited and reminds the listener more of musical recitation than of songs. Certainly, singing is just as important culturally as is storytelling. Spoken texts are often enriched with sung words that underscore the importance of certain names or phrases. In such cases, the genres of stories and songs overlap. An example of this is the Tok Pisin version of \textref{sc0201} \textit{Am}, which is spoken and sung by the storyteller Usikul.
