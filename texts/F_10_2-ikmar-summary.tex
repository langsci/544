I had to see a doctor because of a severe skin rash one day. Margaret accompanied me to town. We could travel in a four-seater Cessna aircraft. It was Margaret's first time on a plane, which is why everyone in town was surprised to suddenly see her there. 
We stayed in the bishop's guest house, where my family and I would normally sleep when we stayed in Vanimo. At times, our daughter Eva would stay with lay missionary friends in Lote, a mission village on a promontory a few kilometres west of Vanimo. 

The story is told from different perspectives. It begins from my perspective. And then Margaret continues from her perspective.
