Unfortunately all the sago bags tipped over into the river. Her husband went empty-handed. There was no sago left on the raft. The river took the sago. The river carried the sago away. Joe didn't navigate the raft well. It bumped against a tree or bumped against a rock. Then all the sago bags fell down into the water.}
