For a while now I had wanted to see a wildfowl nest in the forest. One day Margaret and I set off to find one. The villagers know about such places, of course, and Margaret knew where to go. Wild fowl eggs are a much appreciated addition to meals, especially as chicken eggs are not usually eaten but left to hatch. The location of the nest was about half an hour from the houses of Osi Camp, passing the spot where Margaret and her husband had their small bush hut. Then the track led into the forest. After a while, between the buttressed trunk of a \textit{kwila} tree (\textit{Intsia bijuga}), we saw the big nest of a wild fowl, which is a large ground- breeding bird.
