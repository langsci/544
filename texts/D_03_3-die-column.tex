    \ParallelRText{I seek a \textit{wies}-tree, deep in the bush. The \textit{wies}-trees are quite hidden. I  look around: Where does one stand now? Here stands a \textit{wies}-tree! I collect leaves of the tree. They are collected. I carry them to the house. I cook the \textit{wies}-leaves in one big pot for dying the grass skirts in the liquid. I put the grass skirts into the pot, so the grass skirts will become red now. More people, the women, bring their grass skirts and put them into the \textit{wies}-leach. In the afternoon they take out the grass skirts and bring them to their houses. There they dry the grass skirts in the sun. Now my grass skirts are red.}
