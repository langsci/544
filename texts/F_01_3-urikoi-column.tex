They cut up the meat together, brought it to the house and cooked it in pots. After cooking it they took it off with bamboo tongs and put it into smoking containers. They lit the fire. The heat went up, and the meat dried. The following day the same. Then they returned to the village.}

He held the hand of his wife, and the small child was in the baby sling. When they had crossed and should just touch the river bank, suddenly a crocodile surfaced. The crocodile got hold of the man. The woman and the little child were carried away in the river current. The crocodile ate the husband, it gobbled him up. He was in the crocodile's belly. The mother shouted to the big child: ``Go to the village and tell the people! I'm in the worst condition!'' The boy reached the village and called for help: ``My parents, my parents! My mother and sister are drowning in the river. My father got caught by a crocodile.'' ``Oh, you are lying!'' ``I don't lie, it's true! You come, you all come here.'' Somebody, who had come near, said: ``I thought you were lying, but it's true.'' The boy replied: ``I wasn't lying. I was telling the truth!''}

Having cut, they took the man's head out of the belly. Iwei's head was in the crocodile's belly. They took it and put it on coconut palm fronds. They searched on. They took the limbs and put them also on the palm fronds. The same they did with two bones. One arm has disappeared, the bladder has disappeared, the testicles and the penis have disappeared. They aren't in the crocodiles belly. But where are they? We didn't see them anywhere. They put the man's remains into a small box. Having put them in, the people dug a hole. Then they carried the box to the hole, let it down into the hole, and covered it. }
