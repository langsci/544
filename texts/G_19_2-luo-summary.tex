Money began to play a major role in everyday life in the first decade of the 21st century. Beyond subsistence, people desired goods that were only obtainable in exchange for money. Alternatively, they had to pay others who were no longer willing to exchange natural goods. The value of money was evident to everyone. I remember a situation when I gave two kina to our neighbour's son, who was about ten years old, to help me with some odd jobs. He could hardly believe that he had earned money. 

As for Margaret, she was always more than happy when I paid her for our daily language sessions. However, this sporadic and small income was not her sole source of income. She could rely on some royalties from the timber business in the Kilmeri area (see \cite[9-11]{Gerstner-Link:2018un}). Still, she would sometimes say that she run out of money. She sighed and complained about her sons in particularly.
