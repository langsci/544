Margaret had bad luck one day while working in her garden. She was trying to cut a branch from a tree that had already been felled. Unfortunately, the branch hit her on the forehead and caused a bruise. She must have been terrified by the accident because later she told me that she could just as easily have been killed. A bush knife is certainly not the best tool for chopping thick branches, but she had no axe at her disposal.
