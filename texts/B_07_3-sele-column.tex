Having shot animals, he brought them to the house. They cut the meat and put it on top of the planks. They lit a fire and smoked the meat on the planks. After smoking the meat, the wife slept. Then a snake approached. She didn't sense it because she was sleeping. The wife was sleeping, so she didn't know what happened. The husband didn't see the snake either, since he was roaming the forest. He did not see the snake. The bush spirit snake and the wife had sex the whole time. They were having sex, while her husband was roaming the bush. The bush spirit snake came secretly to her.}

The wife had a big belly: there were two children, a man-like one and a snake-like one. Not long before giving birth the two of them set off. They filled dried meat into the baskets. They wanted to go to the village, but a heavy rain came. A huge rain came; rain and storm broke loose. The rain prevented them from going. They didn't go to the village, but remained in the garden house. So they wanted to go, but no, the rain covered everything. They didn't go, no, no, the rain covered everything. The husband said to his wife: ``You stay, you stay here! You sleep here. I only will go. I alone will spend some nights in the village.''}

The human brother fenced two traps, because he also fenced one for the snake brother. He did the trap fencing. The light of the moon will soon come back. The moon needs to shine. Now the moon shines brightly on the bush tracks. Then they left together. The older brother was lying in wait near the pig trap, and his younger brother was also lying in wait near the pig trap. The snake went first and shot a pig. Having shot the pig, it went ahead and left first. Near the bush camp, it placed a log horizontally. After curling up beneath the log, it put its head outside on top. There it was waiting for the man, its very own brother. When the man had also shot a pig, he stayed in their ready made bush place and straightened it. While sitting he turned his belly there, towards the snake. The snake put its head on top of the log and was watching. It shot arrows at the man's breast until the man is dead. Having killed the man, the snake went home to the village, to its house. The older brother had killed his younger brother. Then he went back to his home in the village. The snake-brother entered its room and curled up on the floor. After curling up at its place, it put its head on top of the body.}
