The sago swamps are full of unpleasant and even dangerous things: an abundance of annoying insects, the large thorns of the sago palms and sharp-edged sago leaves, and pieces of bamboo. Many people walk barefoot, like Susan, because of the wet and soggy ground. Not surprisingly, you can step on thorns or other sharp objects. Some people wear rubber boots, but they are expensive and uncomfortably hot.

Two days after the accident, Susan came to my house, and I treated the deep cut on her foot. Fortunately, that helped. However, Susan is not a woman who likes to rest. The sago swamp is her second home. She can barely imagine a day without going there, unless she is working in her garden. In the end, she was very fortunate as the wound healed quickly.
