    \ParallelRText{I make oil for the hair and for sago pancakes. Sago pancakes I make with it later. Some for the hair, some for sago pancakes. I fetch coconuts and shred them. I make oil. I press the copra and knead it in a pot with some water. Then I pour the liquid in a dish for further use tomorrow. The next morning I process the copra liquid in a pan. I light a fire and heat it on the fire. The flame of the fire blazes up. I let the copra milk boil. The milky liquid boils away. The oil is made. I take it off the fire and put it aside. The oil has to cool down first. Now it is cool. I bottle it with a spoon. I pour it into a bottle. It's good oil. When I made a lot of oil, I offer it on the market for selling. In case I didn't make a lot, but only a little, I bake sago pancakes with it. I don't offer it on the market, it is too little. In case it's only one bottle, I don't offer it for selling. I make sago pancakes with it.}
