While catching fish in a river, one of two sisters is tricked by a bush spirit. She seemed to be lucky, but the many fish she had caught turned out to be the gift of an evil spirit. The spirit did not show itself at the river, but only appeared on her family's doorstep the next morning. Then it demanded that the girl marry it. There was no way out of this situation and, thus, the girl Kusudua followed it down into the river, where both changed into snakes.

It is interesting to note that the sisters fished separately. One is said to have stayed upstream, the other downstream. This fact may indicate a potentially dangerous situation, as the sisters cannot help each other if one of them falls and is caught in a whirlpool. The story could therefore be understood as a warning to stay together and not fish on slippery rocks in the middle of the river. Otherwise one could drown.
