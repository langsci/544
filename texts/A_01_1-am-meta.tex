The story of \textit{Am} was originally told by Usi Kul in Onume/Omoi village in September 2000. Usi Kul tells the story of his ancestors and their way of life as he interprets it in the light of the ``new world'' that the people experience after the encounter with the whites. The story was then retold by Margaret Osi in an abridged version, which was subsequently transcribed. 

It should be mentioned that Usi Kul also gave a version of the story in Tok Pisin. In this version he included parlando phrases which made his narrative performance very special. Most of the names of persons and clans he presented in this parlando mode. I include his Tok Pisin version as a parallel text at the end of this chapter.
