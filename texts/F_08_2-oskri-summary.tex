The provincial capital of Vanimo is within everyone's reach from the village of Ossima. It's a quick journey by car with the public motor vehicle (PMV) or, while I was working on fieldwork, with Jeffrey Osi's farm truck. The slower way is on foot over the hills of Krisa. Many of the villagers used to walk to town, and Margaret did this quite often. The purpose of the journey was both to meet relatives who lived in Vanimo and just to be in town. She wanted to experience the atmosphere of the town, a motivating factor for the trip that should not be underestimated. The walk was exhausting for Margaret who was in her sixties, but she also enjoyed it.
