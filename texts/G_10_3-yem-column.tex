    \ParallelRText{The crowned pigeon flies up into a tree. After alighting on a branch the feathers of its crown wobble. The crowned pigeon has a crest on its head. The feathers of the crowned pigeon have a pattern. The quills of the crowned pigeon are strong; they have no colour and no pattern. Only its side has a pattern. Some of the head feathers are short, some are long. The crest of the crowned pigeon looks like a flower of a tree. One cuts off the crowned pigeon's crest feathers together with some skin of the head. I prepare the crest  of the crowned pigeon as adornment for my hair.}
