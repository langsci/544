    \ParallelRText{Sukupu is a bush spirit, and Kopukei is a human. Kopukei had placed a taboo sign, and the bush spirit had also placed a taboo sign. Kopukei came and cut sago grubs. After cutting them he put them on the ground; several sago grubs fell onto the ground. Kopukei broke the sago grubs, took them and put them in a basket. After a while the bush spirit came; it had heard the noise of breaking wood. The bush spirit saw what happened and said: ``All right, you have cut the sago grubs, we will break them together.'' Soon they had broken all the grubs and come to an end. Kopukei's son wrapped up the grubs in palm leaves, carried them up a tree, hid himself secretly in the top of the tree and was watching what happened on the ground.}

While fighting with sticks, the bush spirit killed Kopukei. He is dead. The spirit also killed Kopukei's wife. It beat her fiercely and fervently with a stick, then she is dead. The evil spirit killed both, husband and wife. First it cut up the father's flesh, then it cut up the mother's flesh. The bush spirit put the flesh of father and mother in a netbag. It filled the netbag up and carried it to his house.}

Now there were only the two heads left in the pot; all the meat has been eaten up. The bush spirit took the brains out of the heads. It took a knife, cut the brains out of the skulls and ate them. Then the bush spirit grasped an axe and said to the people waiting outside his house: ``I come down first, you remain staying there.'' The people were standing around the house and underneath it; they were standing at the corners and on the ladder. They peppered it with arrows, which stuck in its body. So the bush spirit is dying.
