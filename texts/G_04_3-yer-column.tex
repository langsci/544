    \ParallelRText{I met you two at your place. There was a very big river with big rocks. Eva and another small child went down along the river edge towards you. They were looking down, looking down here from the riverbank. They walked downriver along the bank. I was sitting on a rock in the river. A light was shining. I was sitting there. Eva brought an unknown child to me. I looked at her: ``This child which you brought, whose child is it?'' Eva replied: ``I brought my uncle's child.'' A beautiful child. A beautiful girl. I was still sitting on a plank. A light burns, it was shining brightly. I was jealous. What a pretty girl, her hair is nice! I am looking upriver, I am looking downriver. Big rocks spread over the landscape, and there were big mountains. I woke up again. The dream is over.}
