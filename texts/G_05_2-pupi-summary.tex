This text shows Margaret's sensitivity to the atmosphere of an afternoon when everyone is out in their gardens, and all is very quiet. When she started to speak, it almost sounded like a poem. She speaks of the peacefulness of life and nature. The harshness of daily labour seems to have vanished. There is only the presence of silence.
