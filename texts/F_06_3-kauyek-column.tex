    \ParallelRText{At night I followed a cow around. I chased a cow, a cow and its young. But I hadn't seen the young yet. Then I noticed: a cow with its young is moving towards me. They are running. I was watching the animals as if magnetised: ``Numu, come! A cow with its young is running straight towards us. It's coming here quickly. We need to run ourselves.'' We ran. Numu hid away. She sneaked through a hole in the fence. I ran and the cow ran. I slipped and fell over. I called out to Simon: ``Come! Beat the cow with a stick! Help me!'' My arm fell on the back. It twisted. I pondered about what to do. Then I held it with my other hand and stretched it straight. Simon has routed the cow. It has gone. I called Numu: ``Come! Let's go into the house.''}

    \ParallelRText{I lay down to sleep. But I couldn't find sleep. My arm was hurting terribly. I rose in the middle of the night and said to Numu: ``Get up! I'm going to boil water. You light a fire!'' The fire is lit. ``Now fill water in a pot!'' The water became hot and boiled. I took it away from the fire with one hand. ``Go get a piece of cloth,'' I said. Now I press a hot, wet cloth onto my arm. So the blood will flow well through the body. It will diffuse well. Then I went to bed. We two went to bed. I slept until dawn. ``You light a fire again!'' I said to Numu, ``I'll boil water. I'll press again a hot, wet cloth onto my arm.'' I dipped again the piece of cloth into the hot water. I pressed the hot, wet cloth onto my shoulder. I cut my skin. The blood is transparent like water. Other blood, red blood should flow first. The light blood has flown out. No such blood anymore.}

    \ParallelRText{I tried to lift my arm in vain. It hurt terribly. It was tense. I couldn't put on my clothes. I had to wrap slowly a laplap.\footnotemark I put it on slowly. The shoulder continued to hurt terribly. Then I went along the road to Vanimo. Me and Matyu, we walked together. Later a car of the Forest Company took both of us along. This man, who picked us up, was Joe Erima. We drove with him to the Base Camp. Then we jumped on another car. We drove, stood up again on the truck bed, and jumped off at Waisan Camp. There we stayed. In the morning I went to the hospital, I alone. I took a medication, a different one. I took it with water. Then I took many capsules of the medication. I took them home. I swallowed them daily. My arm didn't hurt anymore. It felt a bit better.}
