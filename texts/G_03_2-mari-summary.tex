Margaret often struggled to do her garden work. She loved this work, but was soon exhausted. Margaret suffered from various pains, especially after the accident with the cow (\textref{sc0706}). In such situations she felt somehow betrayed by her sons who did not support her properly. During my stays in field, her situation was improved because we shared all meals. I cooked rice for breakfast. We had a cup of tea and a nice bowl of rice with bananas or sugar every day before the language sessions. She loved starting the day that way.
