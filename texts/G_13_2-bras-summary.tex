When cleaning and weeding around my house, people scared two bandicoots and captured them, a male and a juvenile. Bandicoots are common, and they are easy to catch. The Kilmeri distinguish (at least) five species of bandicoots. One of them lives in the forest, the others in the undergrowth and shrubs around houses. They can often also be caught near one's house. The following short text briefly describes how to catch bandicoots and how to prepare them for a meal. The dried meat of bandicoots is sold in the village market in Ossima (Fig. \ref{fig:bandicoots}).
