    \ParallelRText{Having gone and shoveled two baskets of sago pith, I filled the pith into the baskets for transport. One I lift up on my head, the other one I carried slung around my head. So I carried the baskets. I didn't see the bamboo. There was a big piece of bamboo on the path. I had already stretched down one of my feet. Eh, a bamboo! Srrrrrr! Eh, the blood ran! My brother's son Pita collected leaves of betel pepper. Then he heated them over the fire. He did this almost in vain. No, it didn't help. The blood was like water. The blood was just like water. I felt dizzy. I felt only dizzy. So much blood. The blood streamed only.}

    \ParallelRText{``Give me sago!'' I said. So the people gave me sago. Having eaten some sago, my body felt stronger. But they told me: ``Sit down!'' I had already set down the two baskets of sago pith. My son Ayu carried them later to the kneading trough. While I was sitting, my blood stopped running. My two baskets of sago pith will be washed later. The frogs were croaking. But the bleeding didn't stop. The bamboo cut my foot severely. Finally we arrived at the house, and I went to sleep.}

    \ParallelRText{Wednesday morning I came here to Claudia's house. My family went to wash sago. Having washed my foot with water and soap and put on some medicine, Claudia dressed it with a bandage. She told me: ``Don't go anywhere, stay in the house only! Suppose you would pound sago! The medicine I gave you is strong.'' If I had only listened. But I didn't listen. I didn't wash sago. I was just sitting beside the path. I waited in vain for Matias. Then I turned back home. I had come to the swamp as always. Later I met some people on the way. The people came along by accident. Having met them we all walked to the house together. Yesterday I didn't go anywhere. I rested until nightfall. Today I came here to Claudia.}
