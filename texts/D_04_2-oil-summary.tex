Small-scale private production of coconut oil is very common in Kilmeri villages. Margaret Osi used to do this frequently. The oil is usually produced for personal use. Sometimes a surplus is sold on the local market. But nowadays, home-made coconut oil no longer meets people's needs, so they buy the oil from Vanimo supermarkets. Note that coconut oil is different from palm oil, which is produced in large plantations. Recently, one such plantation was established near Ossima (see \sectref{sec:casheconomy} above).

Interestingly, there is no vernacular word for oil in the Kilmeri language.
