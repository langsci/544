    \ParallelRText{We went into the deep bush. There my husband shot two cassowarries, one boar, lizards, two kangaroos, one crowned pigeon, and one hornbill. I made the planks and filled them with pig and cassowary meat. I put them above the fire. I put everything on top of the planks. I lit a fire. The fire did flames. I blew the fire, and it blazed up. I put meat on the planks, and the meat dried. One morning my husband said: ``We'll go back to the village.'' We came to the village. We  arrived there.}
