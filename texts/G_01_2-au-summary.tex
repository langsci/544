The village of Green is the site of Green River High School in the Upper Sepik region, where Margaret's daughter Grace went to school after finishing 6th grade. Green River High School is a boarding school. However, students are expected to bring some food as school supplies are limited. Packages would sometimes be sent, but every now and then a family member would bring in some food. Margaret was fortunate to get a free flight to Green. For her this was a fantastic experience. For the first time, she saw the mountains from above. Her daughter Grace almost couldn't believe she was seeing her mother on the school grounds. However, this brief reunion is not part of the story. On the return flight to Ossima, the fog lifted.
