How did you come here? I wasn't calling you. Go away! I was calling mother and father.'' She realised that he was a fat, huge man with black skin. He was sitting on the porch. She was looking at him through a hole in the wall. She locked the door. Then she cooked food. After boiling water on the fire, she stirred in sago and cooked meat with \textit{tulip}-vegetables and spinach. She gave it to him through a hole, to a putative  bush spirit. He ate it, and the food did not fall out of his arse. She spoke to herself: ``Oh, he's human. All right, I thought he was a bush spirit and could therefore devour me.'' He slept on the porch, all through the night, until the early morning hours. She said to him: ``Make room, you can't sit in front of the door, move aside! I'm going to the garden and the sago swamp myself.'' She opened the door and wanted to leave. The prospective husband Siyu said to her: ``Where do you get buckets of water?'' She replied: ``Drinking water is upstream.'' ``And where is the bathing place?'' ``Bathing is downstream. I bathe over there.''}
