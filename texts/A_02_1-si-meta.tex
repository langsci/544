The story \textit{Si yelo piyo} `Si took the ground' was told by Margaret Osi in Ossima village in August 2004 and again in February 2007. The story describes the settling of the clan land, the most important event in the history of all Kilmeri-speaking clans. The text was spoken very slowly. Margaret paused repeatedly to recapitulate the generations and the people correctly. She produced the genealogy in August 2004 without being prompted.
