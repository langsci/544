    \ParallelRText{A husband and a wife went to the bush. They went to the bush. They looked for game many days and got a lot. It filled the wife’s baskets. The baskets hang heavily on her back. She carried a heavy load. The husband and the wife, they both carried the meat and walked back towards the village. They already approached the village. But they still had to cross a big river. They went down. The man was first. He managed to cross and waited for his wife on the other side of the river. She was loaded with meat. Slowly she crossed the river. But there was a crocodile that smelled the meat. It came near and got hold of the woman. It pulled her down into its underwater house. Meanwhile the husband got suspicious and looked for her. ``Oh, my wife got caught by a crocodile!'' He took their meat and reached the village. There the people had a big meal.}

They went right to the place where the woman had got caught. There they stayed and started to dive into the river. One man dove first. He came to the crocodile’s house and said: ``We come to get back the woman.'' The crocodile replied: ``Sorry, I won’t give her to you. You just go back.'' So the man left and came back to the river bank. He told the waiting clans: ``The crocodile refused to surrender her.''}

But the man is full of fear. ``I don’t want to go, I don’t want to dive into the river.'' They tried to convince him. He thought about it, and finally he acted. He came to the crocodile’s house and said: ``I come to get back my wife.'' The crocodile replied: ``Finally you came. Wait!'' Then the crocodile continued: ``One arm, I took one arm. You take the body. You take the woman and go up with her.'' The husband brought his wife up to the river bank. There the people dug a grave und put her in. The crocodile had eaten only one of her arms. So they could bring her to the grave and bury her.}
