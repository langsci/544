    \ParallelRText{A husband and a wife went to the bush and stayed there some days. While roaming the bush they caught animals. The wife attached a supporting part on her basket to stabilise it. The husband tied the arrows he had not used on the pannier. Things were ready to go. After having lit a fire for a short sago meal, they transported the killed game in baskets. They carried plenty of meat and climbed the riverbank. The husband descended to the river and went ahead into the water. The husband crossed the river first and then was staying over there on the sand. The wife crossed the river behind him, together with the basket.}

    \ParallelRText{When the wife reached the middle of the river a crocodile caught her there, right in the middle of the river. But the croco\-dile was man-like. The croco\-dile had the spirit of a human. Having caught the wife the crocodile-man carried her inside his house at the bottom of the river, together with the basket of meat. He carried all together, held it and put it inside. Yes, the crocodile is a bush spirit in its house; before the spirit had a crocodile's skin. Only the husband is left. He went alone to the village; he went there crying. He reached the village and told the people: ``My wife! A crocodile caught her together with the killed game. A bush spirit got hold of everything, it took her together with all the meat. Well, after having slept, let's go together to the river tomorrow morning and dive into the water.''}

    \ParallelRText{They were searching jointly for the woman whom the crocodile had caught. One man went down into the water first. Having come down to the bush spirit's house there, he knocked on the door and asked the bush spirit: ``Is the man's wife here?'' ``Yes, she is here, yes.'' ``Won't you give her back to me from your house?'' ``You better go!'' Then the people did nothing but this: A man went down, a man went down, one after the other, one after the other. When the last man came down, he said to the bush spirit: ``Her husband sent me, I will fetch his wife.'' ``Yes, his wife. Tell him: he himself should come down. He should fetch her, he should come and fetch her.'' The last man told that her husband. Now he goes down and says to the bush spirit: ``My wife. You brought her there. You brought her to your house. Is she here?'' ``No, I have eaten her. There is only half of her left, one half only. I tied her remains on the pannier. Now I'll give her to you before you go up again. You carry one half, but the other half I have eaten up.'' Having gone down her husband answered the bush spirit: ``I want to carry her up.'' The bush spirit gave her remains to him together with the pannier. Half of her it had cut off in the middle. One half it had cut off and eaten up. The husband carried her remains up to the riverbank.}
