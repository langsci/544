Traditionally, birds are hunted with bow and arrow. This is a fairly silent way to kill them. Sometimes a shotgun is also used, as in the case of Lis Osi, Margaret's husband. In her report, Margaret switches to the first-person perspective and tells us that she herself is the hunter. Normally, women would not hunt for birds or game.

Note that the same vocabulary is used for rifle shooting as for traditional hunting. The bow is equivalent to the rifle, and the arrows are equivalent to the cartridges. The verb \textit{pulapi} ‘to draw a bow’ means ‘to load and aim with a rifle’ in the modern context.
