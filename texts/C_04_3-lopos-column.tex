    \ParallelRText{My father cut posts. He cut them to size. He felled other trees and cut them in shape from trunk to top. He felled more and cut them in shape from trunk to top. He felled still more trees and cut them in shape from trunk to top. He put together six posts and placed them on the ground. Finally he went back home to our house and rested there for one full day. He thought about what to do next. ``We go and carry the posts.'' So we went off, me together with my parents. We arrived at the place where the posts were laid down. There we were staying and lit a fire. My father started carrying posts and put them at the place of the new house. He returned, took others, and carried them to the place of the house. He came back again, took another one, and carried it to the construction site. He laid it down there. He was busy like this. He transported trunks and stems unceasingly. He lifted a post, carried it, laid it down at the future place of the house. He came back, lifted another one, carried it, and laid it down at the construction site. He came back again. Finally, only one post was left. He lifted it, carried it, and went ahead. We followed him: ``You come behind. I'll carry the post ahead.''}

The water boiled. She stirred sago in. The sago is ready. She portioned it and cut it into pieces on leaves. Then she cooked \textit{tulip}-vegetables with mushrooms. She turned vegetables and mushrooms over. They are getting done, they are done. She took the pot off the fire and set it on the floor. It has to cool first. It is still hot. Now it has cooled down. She distributed the food on plates. She gave one plate to my father, gave one to me, and gave one to my brother. She also ate. We were eating vegetables and mushrooms with sago. The food is eaten up. We have finished all of it. We were sitting and resting. The dusk makes its noises. The night comes. Soon it is completely dark. My father left. He went to the men's house and slept there. I myself slept with mother and brother. We were fast asleep, fast asleep. Then the birds sang, all of them sang. Dawn comes in. Daylight rises. The darkness is over. It is morning.}

Now they are erected. Horizontally he laid along the supporting beams over the posts. They are put in position. He tied them together with rope. Many of them need to be tied together. He tied together all the supporting beams of the house with rope. He placed the crossbeams and tied them together with rope. They are all tied together. He tied the roof joints together with rope. They are tied together. Then he placed the floor planks on the supporting beams. He tied together the floor planks of the house with rope. They are tied together. He made the sago thatches. They are sown. He placed the sago thatches on top of the roof beams and tied everything together going up to the roof ridge. Then half of the roof is finished. The dusk sounds. The night falls in. The night is over. The dawn has approached. He made the other half of the roof. He made all the sago thatches for the other side. They are made. Then he fenced the walls. He fenced the walls together with many other people. Quite some people helped him. Now the walls are finished.}

    \ParallelRText{The fireplace is left to be made. He put a palm mat on the floor and fetched soil. He put  the soil on the palm mat and trampled it with his feet. He poured down a little water and smoothed out the soil on the fireplace with a stick. Now the fireplace gets hard. Well, the fireplace is ready for use. Finally he made the door, one opening only. He cut out a hole. Other openings he didn't cut out. He had fenced all the sides of the house. There was only a hole towards one side of the house for the smoke to go, the smoke outlet of the house. The smoke goes out that way, namely through the smoke outlet of the house. Then he fastened bolts on the door. Nobody can open the door at night. A sorcerer cannot open it. At last he made the ladder. He tied it together with rope. The ladder is ready and one can enter the house properly. The next day we spent like this: We placed several boards on the walls. Then we took down our belongings from the old house and carried them to the new house. All the belongings: the bush knifes, the axe, the pots, the baskets, the sago flour, everything. From now on we stayed in the new house. My father took a good rest. He rested for a long time. He rested for a full month.}
