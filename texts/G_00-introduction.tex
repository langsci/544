This chapter features a loose collection of short texts, some of which are no longer than two sentences. They constitute colloquial Kilmeri speech that was not prompt\-ed by me. Margaret Osi, the author, speaks her mind freely. Here we get to witness her perception and interpretation of the world vibrating around her.

Some of these texts contribute to the understanding of Kilmeri social life today (Texts \ref{sc0801}, \ref{sc0803}, \ref{sc0811}, \ref{sc0815}, \ref{sc0819}). Other texts revolve around the themes of gardening, sago work, and hunting (Texts \ref{sc0802}, \ref{sc0807}, \ref{sc0809}, \ref{sc0810}, \ref{sc0812}, \ref{sc0813}, \ref{sc0814}, \ref{sc0816}, \ref{sc0818}, \ref{sc0820}). Also included are texts that express Margaret Osi's personal moods, which she wanted to share with me (Texts \ref{sc0804}, \ref{sc0805}, \ref{sc0806}, \ref{sc0808}, \ref{sc0817}).

I am just as grateful for these short texts as I am for the many long texts. They round off the picture of Margaret Osi's personality, who was indeed an outstanding woman. The reader may enjoy reading these episodes in special memory of her. She was well aware of the fact that her language and culture could not stand up to the developments of modern times, which have completely changed people's lives.
