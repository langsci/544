This is a memory of a hunt in the (late?) 1970s, when the Ossima Mission had already existed for nearly twenty years. The seventies and eighties were a cultural transition period from the old customs to the new way of life. Note that some of the meat was sold at the market in Vanimo. We can see that hunting had become a means of generating surpluses in addition to subsistence gardening.
