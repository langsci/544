Margaret describes the idleness of the cows, who do no more than eat grass. In Ossima and the neighbouring villages, cows were widespread and were part of the villagers' daily lives. They were introduced by the mission's farm administration in the 1960s. Right behind the houses of Osi Camp, where I lived, a herd of cows was seeking shade under the trees in the heat of the day.
