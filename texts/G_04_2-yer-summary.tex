Every now and then Margaret would share a dream 
she had dreamed the previous night. This time, 
she dreamed of me and my daughter Eva. Though she was sure the scene of the dream was in my country, the setting resembled the upper reaches of the Puwani River. Margaret mentions a second child who is probably a friend of Eva's who had visited us in Ossima a few years ago. Just like Eva, this girl had beautiful, curly, light-coloured hair. And Margaret always admired that kind of hair.
