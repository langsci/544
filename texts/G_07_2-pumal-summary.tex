Margaret talks about the water level in the sago swamps, which is important for the processing of sago. If the water level drops too low, the sago swamps almost dry up, and processing sago is no longer possible. It is therefore important to check the water level. It is impossible to do this with the naked eye because the water in the swamp is nearly black.
