At one point, Mili, the daughter of Charles Osi and his wife Imelda, had to be taken to the hospital in Vanimo for treatment. She was suffering from a serious wound that could not be treated in the village of Ossima. It was not clear what the cause of this severe, ulcerated wound was. Mili's mother could not accompany her because of their other four children. So Margaret Osi went to the hospital together with Mili and stayed with her during the long weeks of treatment. After the ulcer had been successfully excised, a skin transfer was necessary. The doctor removed a piece of skin from Mili's thigh. 

Ulcerating infections under the skin are quite common in the forest. Some of them heal on their own. Others can be cured with a special antibiotic. If such medication is not available, the inflammation may become so severe that a sepsis is possible. Then an operation is required.
