The \textit{masalai} or `bush spirit' of Susan's story has a family and seems to live in a settlement like humans do. The surprising part of the story is the fact that the bush spirit's own people killed it because they mistook it for the human prey. Afterwards, only the sister of the murdered bush spirit refuses to eat its flesh. This accidental killing enabled the human to escape and return to his village.

Note the opening sentence of the story \textit{mi laik wokim stori bilong masalai} (`I like to work on a story about a bush spirit'). This could indicate that the story is `reworked' and thus re-enacted in front of an audience each time it is told.
