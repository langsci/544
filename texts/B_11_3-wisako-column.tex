    \ParallelRText{A man laid out a big garden. A garden that covered a large terrain. He laid banana plantations out: \textit{pasok}, \textit{pailili}, \textit{paisol}, \textit{panpal}, \textit{paipines}, \textit{klapua}, \textit{pamapup}, \textit{paipopo}. He planted tobacco shoots. He planted spinach, wild sugar cane, stick taro, sugar cane, betel nuts, yams, and sweet potatos. One day all the vegetables were good for harvesting. The moon woman came and was looking at the garden, ``Eh, the bananas are all good, they have become ripe.'' She went back to her house, took a bush knife, cut plenty of bananas, and carried them home. She returned to the garden and  grabbed more food. With tobacco, spinach, and \textit{aibika} she left. She filled baskets with betel nuts and wild sugar cane and carried everything to her house. But soon the food was completely consumed. The house was empty.}

    \ParallelRText{The man went himself to his garden, ``Eh, who cut my bananas? What am I going to do now? I will stay and watch closely. I'll hide well. Which person will come here? Who secretly steals my things?'' At night a woman came in the garden. The man was standing at the foot of a \textit{pasok}-banana, ``Eh, a woman is walking around and looking for bananas.'' She cut four bananas and a \textit{pasok}-banana, five bunches of bananas. She put them on the ground. While the man was standing there within touching distance, she put them on the ground. Then he stretched out his arms and held her tightly. He grabbed the moon woman with both hands and said: ``Now I have seen you. You did that by habit. Now we two will go together to my house.'' But the moon woman said to him: ``No, we'll go to my house.'' So they went to her house and were living there. The moon woman gets pregnant. Then they went to the man's village. There he left her behind at the toilet house. The man asked his first wife: ``Do you agree that I brought another wife?'' ``Where did you leave her?'' ``I left her over there. I wanted to ask you first.'' ``Yes, I agree, go bring her! We'll live together.'' He took the new wife to the house. The first wife said to her: ``Come, you live in this place. I live here, you live there.'' So they were living on.}

At that the moon woman said to the first wife: ``Leave me your child. You take my child.'' She locked the door behind her. Then the moon woman took buckets to the river and carried water back to the house. She cleaned the floor and the boards in the house. Then she made a long ladder. She made a ladder up to the sky. The sky is very close. She made a baby sling for the child: a sling in the back, a sling in the front, a sling around the neck. The moon woman carried the boy piggyback.}
