She let the child sleep on a platform and was busy pounding sago. Then she got the trough for kneading and washing the sago pith ready. She brought the pith to the washing place and washed it in the trough. The child was sleeping, and she was busy washing sago. Soon she had finished the pith. She brought more and went on washing the pith. Again the pith is finished. So she went once more to get a new load of pith for processing. Carrying sago pith and washing it kept her busy for quite some time. Finally she had used up all the pith. Now she cleaned the filtering net and the trough.}
