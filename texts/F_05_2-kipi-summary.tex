Returning home from the sago swamp with two heavy baskets of sago flour, Susan fell from the platform of her house in Ossima Asples. The platform is like an open veranda without railings. When you put down a heavy load -- wet sago or firewood or a basket of coconuts -- you have to be careful to maintain balance. Susan was probably exhausted and wanted to quickly get rid of the load. That is how the accident happened. 

Once again we see that sago processing is Susan's way of life. In her home village, she received no support from her brothers. After the death of her husband, she was living alone having to feed four children. Sago makes up a family's staple diet. This meant that Susan had to do her sago work almost every day. Only the older ones of her twelve children were able to provide for themselves in their own families.
