    \ParallelRText{Two sisters went fishing in the river. The younger one caught fish upriver, and the older one downriver. The younger sister caught many fish, but the older one caught only very few fish. Then the sisters turned back home and carried the fish with them. The older sister said to the younger: ``You caught a lot of  fish, but me, I didn't catch many.'' The younger sister replied: ``You didn't catch the right way.'' ``No, I did it well.'' Then the two sisters turned back home. The older sister informed the mother: ``My younger sister caught lots of fish, but me, I didn't catch many.'' The older sister countered: ``As for you, someone gave you the fish to take.'' ``No, I myself caught them, there wasn't anybody else.'' Then the two sisters went inside their room and slept.}

    \ParallelRText{The next morning, a bush spirit, a snake, had come. It was sitting on the ladder. It changed appearance and looked like a man, standing on the ladder. Its name is Mawatkawi. Father and mother said to the bush spirit, the snake: ``What did you come for?'' The bush spirit, the snake, replied: ``I do not come for certain things. I come for your child.'' Father and mother repeated their question: ``What did you come for? What do you want? A dog, a pig, chicken, fish, coconuts, breadfruit, sago?" It doesn't speak. Father and mother repeated once more: ``What do you want?'' The bush spirit, the snake, said to them: ``Me? I want a wife, your daughter.'' Father and mother told the sisters: ``While you were catching fish, the snake, a bush spirit, came here.'' The older sister said to the younger: ``You were catching lots of fish, not me. Only you were taking them, not me.''}

The bush spirit, the snake, went ahead and Kusudua walked behind. She followed it with her parents; they accompanied her. They stood at the edge of the river. Then the snake gave its skin to Kusudua who now also looks like a snake. Then the snake changed back its own appearance from man to snake, and they went down into the river. They are gone for ever.
