The meat he always ate alone; he didn't give the older brother any of it. He sleeps, he goes hunting into the bush, shoots animals, and brings them home. There he eats them together with his children and his wife, they alone. The older brother only receives the skin of the animals.}

The younger replied: ``Take the dogs with you!'' He took them with him to the bush. The dogs barked loudly (and startled) the cassowaries. He shot a pig and a cassowary. In order to cool the killed animals, he put them into the river and set a taboo sign; then he carried on hunting. He shot a boar. He put the boar into the river and set a taboo sign; then off he went again. He shot a cassowary; the dogs had barked (and startled) the cassowaries. Having shot one, he put it into the river and set a taboo sign. Off he went again and took the dogs with him. The dogs barked loudly for kangaroos. The two dogs caught a kangaroo, it is dead. He put it into the river and set a taboo sign. Then he went on for hunting. He shot a sow; the dogs had barked loudly. He put the sow into the river and set a taboo sign.}

Then he looked, ``Eh, there is a big lizard.'' The father hid in the buttress of an ironwood tree. He released an arrow. It stuck in the monitor lizard's body, there it was. The lizard turned its body towards him, and the father released one more arrow aiming at the lizard. Then the monitor lizard jumped and got hold of the man. Together with the tree it threw the man over and cut in half man and tree. The lizard's body and tail are like a saw. It aimed its teeth and cut apart man and tree. It cut him in two at his belly, and the man is dead.}

The bush spirit rubbed the dog's face with blood, and the dog carried it to the mothers. One brought the father's hair, the other one the father's blood. Meanwhile the bush spirit took the dead man's head and arms and carried them down to the water. It also carried the two legs down to the water. It brought plenty of human flesh to its place; it carried it to its underwater house. Then the spirit put the man's penis cover upright beside the water. It fastened it there on a stick.}

The two wives opened the door: ``No, nothing, there's nobody. But what is this? This is his spirit.'' Their hearts flooded like water. They thought about what could have happened. The dogs hadn't come yet. Finally the dogs arrived at the house. The mothers were listening to their noise; then they opened the door. They put fire on a chip of wood, it burns, the flame burned. The mothers gazed at the dogs' mouths: One dog has blood rubbed on, the other dog brought hair. The two mothers caught sight of the dogs' mouths, their faces, their teeth: The hair between the teeth of one dog, the blood on the face of the other dog. The mothers wept.
