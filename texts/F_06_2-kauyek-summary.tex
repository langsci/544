The Ossima Mission had an agricultural branch in order to improve nutrition and train young men in cattle breeding. There were therefore several herds of cows grazing in the immediate vicinity of the houses at Osi Camp. The fences were often broken, and the animals could roam freely. One night this happened again, and Margaret took action. She tried to chase a particular cow back beyond the fences. Unfortunately, she tripped and seriously injured her shoulder and upper arm. I was not there to witness the accident as it happened a few months before my 2006 field trip.
