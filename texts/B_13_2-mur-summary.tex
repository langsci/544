This is a traditional story, which is widely known in the western part of Papua New Guinea. Probably, it originates from the Kopar and Watam people in the coastal area of the East Sepik province. Margaret Osi and Susan Bisam both knew the story. I asked Margaret to tell it in Kilmeri, and she did that without hesitation. For a more elaborated version of the story see \nocite{Slone:2001ux} \citet[591-592]{Slone:2001uz}: ``Why Cassowaries Do Not Fly Anymore''. 

The cassowary is a flightless bird, although it has the phenotypic characteristics of a bird. This obvious discrepancy had to be explained and probably motivated people to invent a story. In Kilmeri folk taxonomy, cassowaries are not categorised as birds but as ground-living animals such as pigs, kangaroos, possums, rats, etc.
