For several years, Margaret Uma, a distant relative of Jeffrey Osi, had her house in Osi Camp. The family 
previously lived in Osol, but had run into difficulties there. Jeffrey Osi wanted the woman and her family to move to his land, but they were not welcomed by the villagers and neighbours. When I returned to fieldwork one year, the house was no longer there. Margaret Osi told me that it had been deliberately burnt down. So the family left the place.

In order to make some money, people would produce sago for the market in Vanimo. Sometimes the roads to Vanimo were in such a bad condition that travelling by car was not possible. People would then build rafts and travel down the Puwani to the shore, where they could find a car. This was the plan of Joe, Margaret Uma's husband. He was not experienced in navigating a raft on the river and did not know his way around hidden rocks and driftwood. As a result, he lost all the sago that his wife had prepared for sale in Vanimo.
