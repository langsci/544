    \ParallelRText{I went to the garden. I was working in the garden. I was hewing off branches of a tree, a \textit{ton}-tree. I was hewing off a branch of a \textit{ton}-tree. I was hewing it off with the bush knife. One end of a branch I hold firmly with my foot. But the other end flipped against me. The branch hit and injured my head. I must have turned away. Then my forehead swelled up. If the branch had hit my face, then I would have died. Later on you would have come and asked David: ``Margaret isn't there?'' David had replied: ``Margaret died. We buried her in a grave.''}
