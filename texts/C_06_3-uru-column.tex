    \ParallelRText{Two brothers went to the bush. They were roaming the bush. They got to see a huge lizard. The lizard had climbed up a tree and was sitting there high up. The older brother said to the younger brother: ``You stay on the ground. I'll climb up after the lizard.'' He took bow and arrows and climbed up the tree. Having found a good position, he shot at the big lizard. He took one arrow. He shot. The arrow stuck in the lizard's body. He released another arrow. He released the third arrow. He released the fourth arrow. Six arrows altogether. Now the arrows are finished. The big lizard bit the man's hand. Then it bit his neck. It cut the man's neck. Its teeth are very long, like a saber. The man died above in the tree. He is dead. The lizard jumped onto another branch of the tree and was sitting there.}

    \ParallelRText{The younger brother twined up a liana and took it up the tree. Then he carried the older brother down to the ground by means of the liana-sling. He brought him to the village. The people there asked him: ``What happened to your older brother?'' ``A huge lizard bit him.  He died. He is dead.'' He carried him to the house. Inside the house they held a wake for the dead man. One night the people held the wake, until dawn. Then they dug a hole, carried the corpse to the hole, and threw it inside. They covered the hole. Having covered the hole the people went off to cut the tree, where the goanna had been. They cut the tree, and it fell over to the ground along with the goanna. After attacking the lizard with arrows they beat its neck with sticks. Finally it is dead. Having cut wood they lit a fire. Then they were cutting up the flesh of the huge lizard. After cutting it in pieces, they put it on the fire. It is done. They took the pieces off the fire with bamboo tongs. The people ate the meat of the lizard. They were expected to share it among themselves. They ate the lizard's meat with sago.}
