    \ParallelRText{A man roamed the bush. He went at night and wanted to look for pigs. He set off and was roaming the bush. He thought: ``I'll take a light.'' His hand grabbed into his netbag, and he got a light. It was a different light, not a true torch light. The light was beaming. The light was flickering. A different type of torch light. Flicker, flicker, flicker. The light flickers.}

    \ParallelRText{A snake directs its eyes to the light: ``Tststs tststs.'' A bad sound. ``Who does this to me?'' thinks the man. Then he took a true torch. The light spreaded: ``Eh, a snake, this is a snake. A huge snake. The snake will certainly bite me.'' The man must have run away. He went fast. Bow and arrows and the bush knife he put somewhere. Frustrated he  also left his netbag there. He ran empty-handed. He took only the torch light, to the village, at night. He told the people: ``The snake didn't manage to bite me. I came back here. I was afraid. Tomorrow I'll go. I go to get bow and arrows, the bush knife and the netbag.''}

    \ParallelRText{In the morning he left for the bush. So he got his things and came back to the village. He has gotten all the equipment. Havinf come to the village, he remained there. He warned the people: ``Don't take the different light! It's bad! This light makes a snake hostile. While the snake looks at it, the light flickers like a snake's skin. Snakes will bite us often. Abandon this light! At night we come with a wooden torch, which is a good torch. A glowing piece of wood is much better.''}
