The story goes back to the knowledge of John Sol from Isi Camp, a hamlet about 1 km from Ossima. There is a wide expanse of metre-high \textit{kunai} grass (\textit{Imperata cylindrica}) between the houses of Isi Camp and the Puwani River, which you have to cross to reach the sandy riverbank. The inhabitants of Isi Camp are from the village of Isi, 3-4 km south of Kiliwes. As they belong to the larger Imo clan, they were permitted to settle in the area of Ossima, which is also a settlement of the Imo clan. The large fissure in the earth near Kiliwes is called Yi.

The Sequences \ref{ex:nrexseiwel}-\ref{ex:nrexwilkob} are a free association that follow the actual story line. The ``exchange'' of weapons implies a sense of great loss after the arrival of the whites, who seemed to be so much stronger.
