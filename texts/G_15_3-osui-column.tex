    \ParallelRText{We have seen it. He has died. The corpse is stiff. We all were fast asleep. During the night we didn't look after him on his bed. We thought he was fast asleep. We called all the people: ``We didn't look for him. We were sleeping. The man has died. You all come!'' The people come and sit down. They cry for him, they stay crying. His maternal uncle, his older brother, his father, his paternal uncle, his nephews, his grandparents. Then the crying is over. ``You go back now to your places.''}
