    \ParallelRText{This bush spirit. A man built a pig trap in the sago swamp. He lay in wait for a long time. Nothing. He didn’t find a pig. His eyes were tired, and he slept on a pangal-platform. He was fast asleep and slept on and on. In the night a bush spirit was walking around and looking for food. It approached and saw the pangal-platform. A platform the women use for washing their sago. It saw the man. Oh, poor man! It lifted him up together with the platform. It carried him easily talking to itself: You carry him, you walk and walk along. You are halfway now.}

He hangs with his hands on the liana. And the bush spirit carried an empty platform! It went on and reached its house. The man had kept hold of the liana and climbed a tall tree. He climbed high up.
