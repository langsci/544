The text describes a rather unusual incident: a man dies unexpectedly in his home. Nobody had expected it. The death was not blamed on sorcery because there were no previous signs of some serious illness at the time. The man had simply died in his sleep. People were shocked when they found out the next morning. The relatives were summoned to the house of the deceased for a mourning ritual. The relatives who attended the ritual, were listed according to their unique names. Once the mourning ritual was over, the guests were dismissed. The phrase \textit{ine mole} `You are all leaving' is the usual formula for dismissing visitors (cf. \cite[143]{Gerstner-Link:2018un}). It can be reinforced by the terminative suffix -\textit{we}, which here indicates that people should return to their daily routine.
