She was in this condition for a long time, day and night. She couldn't sleep. Her granddaughter Abaidja gave her food. Abaidja helped her all the time. Helen couldn't stretch her legs. The sinews cramped in both knees. She often urinated. Large amounts of urine were spreading about like water. The urine stinks. The urine had begun to stink. Abaidja alone was helping her. All the people neglected her. Helen was alone
with Abaidja. They two slept together in one room.}

    \ParallelRText{Then Abaidja became sick. She was very sick. Helen's only daughter Sabeth didn't help her mother. She turned her back on her. Then I helped Helen. Theresia and I washed her things, and we washed Helen with soap. She was very dirty. She was in a pitiful state. Denis the nurse dressed her sores. So many worms on her legs! The worms covered the legs. There were ulcers on her behind. She was only whimpering from pain, day and night. Yessica put a lamp there. But Helen knocked it over with her foot towards herself. The mosquito net caught fire, her legs, her behind, and her hip caught fire. Only flames. Helen refused food, refused sago. Her mouth didn't make sounds any more. Her mouth is shut. Only the heart was still beating. Only the heart still continued to beat for a long time.}

    \ParallelRText{One night she died. People came and looked at her. Only the heart was still beating. I asked the heavenly Father and prayed to God: ``Prepare the way for her, open the door for her, wash her with your blood. She shall be clean with your blood.'' Then she finally died. Her spirit went back to its home. It has gone. The people cried. For a while they were crying. Then the people surrounded Helen in their traditional way. She died on a Saturday. Jeffrey, her second born son, was in Vanimo. Pius told Jeffrey via cell-phone: ``Your mother has died. Come here!'' And Jeffrey came to the village. David fixed the coffin for her. The people put her in the coffin. Other people were digging a hole. Having dug hole deep enough, the grave is ready.
