    \ParallelRText{One day the hornbill said to the cassowary: ``Why do you live above in the trees? You won't live there anymore. You'll come down to the ground.'' The hornbill broke the cassowary's wings. The cassowary came down to the ground. The tree branch broke. The cassowary fell down to the ground together with the branch. The hornbill broke the branch where it was sitting. The cassowary tried to move its wings. It tried that in vain. The hornbill has broken the cassowary's wings. It cannot fly anymore. So the cassowary sat on the ground. The cassowary's wings were broken alltogether. Now the hornbill went up in the trees. There it sat. Finally they live forever like this: The cassowary took over the hornbill's place, and the hornbill took over the cassowary's place.}
