    \ParallelRText{I said to Eva: ``Hurry up! Go tell Margaret: `I am asking you something. My mother wants you. Come!'{''} Eva told her: ``Grandmother, get up! Hurry up! Claudia wants you!'' Then Margaret came and saw Claudia. ``Margaret, I got a rash. I'll go to the hospital, to Vanimo. Let's go. Will you come, do you agree?'' I thought about it. First I wanted to think about it: ``I have bought food. The people should pound sago pith for me. All the money I have flung away. My food I gave to my son David. But alright, be it as it is. Let's go. I'll come with you.''}

Kevin replied: ``Yes, I brought them, yes. We are four.'' We entered the plane and the door closes. Its engine started, the plane rose, it is flying. The plane went with us and landed in Vanimo.}

If there is no liquid and they are dry, in that case it is alright. If there is still liquid and they are not dry, then you take a different medicine.''}
