The river carried Sakou away, but a \textit{kup}-liana clung to him and he held on it. Holding on to the liana, he climbed up from the mud onto the riverbank. He looks up: ``There are a lot of ripe \textit{wo\-ppuo}-fruits.'' Having climbed the tree, he sat on one of its branches. He plucked some fruits and ate them; then he looked down.}

    \ParallelRText{In the meanwhile a cassowary had come and was eating ripe \textit{wo\-ppuo}-fruits. It came again and was eating more fruits. Sakou thought, ``What do I do now?'' His hand ran through his hair; there was a sharp cassowary bone in the hair. He pulled the cassowary bone out of his hair. Then he plucked ripe \textit{wo\-ppuo}-fruits and pierced them on the sharp bone. Afterwards, he threw the speared fruits down to the cassowary. As the cassowary ate, he could not swallow the pierced fruits, because the sharp bone got stuck in his throat. So the cassowary would surely die. The cassowary died. It was dead. ``What should I do now?'' Sakou called out to his sisters in the village; he called and called for them, but no one answered. The older and the younger sister, nothing. A bush spirit answered him. Its name is Sukupu. So the bush spirit came. When Sukupu had come, Sakou called out again and the spirit answered him.}
