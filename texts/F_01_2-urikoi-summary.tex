This is a tragic story about river crocodiles attacking humans. The events described probably took place in the 1970s near Ossima, when there were still large crocodiles in the Puwani River. At that time, great caution was always required when crossing the river. An attack was always a possibility. The incident in question seemed to have thrown the whole village into a frenzy. After the crocodile's attack, a thorough search was launched for the remains of the victim. Part of his body was found in the crocodile's stomach. The remains of the man were later buried in a coffin like an intact corpse. This corresponds to the practice described in the crocodile bush spirit story (cf. \textref{sc0307}). From this we can conclude that it was crucial to guide the deceased, represented by the corpse (or at least some of its remains), into the world of spirits through an appropriate ritual, be it traditional or Christian. Only in this way could his good spirits protect the rest of the family (cf. \textref{sc0405}).
