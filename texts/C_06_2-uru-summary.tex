This is a hunting story. Two brothers went hunting, but one of them was fatally wounded by the bite of a dangerous lizard. \textit{Urual} refers to \textit{Varanus salvadorii}, the ``Papuan monitor lizard'' from the Varanidae family, which is endemic to New Guinea (see comment on \textref{sc0302}). The story tells us that this animal was previously hunted for its meat. I assume that Andrew Wapi witnessed such hunting activities when he was young. The final sequence states that these lizards were common in the lowland forests and gives advice on how to kill them.

In this story, the deceased is buried in the ground, but without a coffin. The wake he received is a traditional custom. This part of the ritual after a death in the village is missing in \textref{sc0405} above. The reason for this could be that the man in question died in the bush and was not transferred to the village before the cremation ritual took place. I was told that such cremations never took place near settlements, but some distance away in the bush.
