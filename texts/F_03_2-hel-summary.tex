Helen Osi was the first wife of Lis Osi, the ``modern mind'' and leader of Ossima village. After his death she lived on for another ten years and received support from her second son Jeffrey Osi. Her first-born son Paul Waia had moved to Port Moresby. Helen passed away in 2005. In the last phase of her life she became frail and seemed to suffer from dementia. Helen often sat in an unfinished house where she kept her own fire and cooked for herself. But the fire that killed her occurred in her old house not far from her son's family. She was buried in the garden of my house, and a coconut tree was planted. Note that Jeffrey Osi feels the need to state clearly that his mother's death was a natural occurrence because of her age and the fire. He wants to cast aside thoughts of magic and superstition.
