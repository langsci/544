The milky sap of the frangipani trees (\textit{Plumeria sp.}) contains a caustic irritant which is used to catch fish. Margaret always told me about these local customs whenever we went for a walk together. 

Plumeria is native to tropical America. Its main centre is the island of Cuba where there are ten endemic species. The tree with its marvellous, often fragrant flowers was introduced to Hawaii in 1860 and subsequently cultivated there. Today it is widespread in the Pacific Islands.
