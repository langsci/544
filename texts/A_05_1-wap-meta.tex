The story of \textit{Wapues} was told by Margaret Osi in Ossima village in February/March 2000. The protagonists of the story are Wapues and Siyu. Wapues is a girl from Omula, who meets her designated husband Siyu from Ossima. The story confirms the relationship between two clans that have settled in different places along the Puwani River. This oral history was known to Lis Osi of Ossima (upstream on the right bank) and Iwei Wai of Omula (downstream on the left bank).

The text shows some code switching to Tok Pisin. Indeed, Margaret Osi began the story in Tok Pisin. This is presented and translated in the first three paragraphs of the parallel text version, but it is omitted in the interlinear text version below.
