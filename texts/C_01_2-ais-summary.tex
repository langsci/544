Margaret's father is said to have died through the intervention of sorcerers, who caused him to die slowly through attack spells. The victim was still alive a few days after the attack, but it is said that he was still killed by the attack. Here Margaret adopts the widespread line of argument that a person's death is never caused by medical problems but by human intervention, especially sorcery (see \cite[14-15]{Gerstner-Link:2018un}). This position was not discussed between her and me.

The story begins with the wizards' ambush after her father Apai has had a happy hunting experience. Then the sick man is taken from the bush hut to Ninggera and from there to Pasi near Vanimo. Instead of seeking help at the hospital in Vanimo, he was taken further to the villages -- probably to Omoi -- and to his relatives. He soon died there and then was given a Christian burial. I was told that people still wish to die in their own village rather than in a foreign place.
