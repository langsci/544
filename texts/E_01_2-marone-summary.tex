Margaret Osi told me this first version of her life story in the earliest days of fieldwork. It is very short and linguistically most simple, but contains the most important steps of her life (cf. \cite[926-927]{Gerstner-Link:2018un}). The sequence of short clauses perfectly presents the basic SOV word order of Kilmeri.
