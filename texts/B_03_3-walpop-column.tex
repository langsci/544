    \ParallelRText{Two sisters took one husband. The older sister got pregnant, but the younger sister was not pregnant and was living like single. Their husband withheld the food; he used to eat alone. Only he would eat meat, fish, and sago. The two wives reflected: ``Let's go, we look for the river. Did it dry up?'' They went there and saw that the river has dried up. Having staked off a small basin downriver, they scooped it empty with a \textit{pangal}-shovel. No water was left. Only the bottom of the river was visible, and there were fish, namely shrimps, \textit{wamo}-fish, \textit{weripi}-fish, \textit{waesopp}-fish, and \textit{weiop}-fish. The sisters saw meat for food. They put aside two \textit{pangal}-baskets full of fish. Then they noticed a hole. They saw the footprints of a small turtle, right here the traces go straight up. Then the younger sister said to the older: ``You stay here, because you are pregnant. I will go up.'' The older sister replied: ``No, I will go up myself.'' So the older sister came to the house of the bush spirit. Her younger sister waited in vain and wept until evening. She tipped the \textit{pangal}-containers with the fish across the river and went home crying. She said to her husband: ``You always ate the meat alone. My sister disappeared. She went up to the cave of a small turtle. Now the bush spirit will eat her. I waited for her in vain. You yourself ate everything alone, you didn't give us any meat.'' The husband started weeping, but his wife said to him: ``Don't even cry, you alone ate. Your bad habit caused her trouble.''}

    \ParallelRText{The older sister went to the bush spirit's house and reached it. ``Where did you come from?'' she was asked. She replied, ``I expected a small turtle there.'' ``A small turtle? No, it's me. Come, you will live on the other side of the house.'' The wife gave birth to a boy in the bush spirit's house. The bush spirit saw her. There were two ladders. One belonged to the bush spirit's room, the other one belonged to the woman's room. The placenta fell down, the bush spirit cut the umbilical cord and ate it readily. Then it fell out of its anus and dropped on the ground. The wife realised: ``Oh, this one is a bush spirit! I expected it to be human, but this one is a bush spirit. It will devour me soon.'' She lived on with a sad heart: ``What am I going to do now?'' While she was living like this, the bush spirit went to the bush. It shot humans and shot animals and brought them to the house. It gave the animals' meat to the woman. But what about the human flesh, did it eat it? The bush spirit surely hid when eating human flesh. It lived on like this. Meanwhile the child crawls, the child stands up, walks on his feet, has become big. One day the bush spirit decided: ``I go collect \textit{aibika}-leaves.'' It went to the garden, which was far away. Having left, it collected \textit{aibika}-leaves.}

    \ParallelRText{At once a man named Bipep came to the bush spirits house and said to the woman: ``Come, let's go away from here, the bush spirit will eat you up soon. You together with your child, let's go now, come on! I won't eat you, I will help you.'' The older sister and her child followed Bipep and they were living in Bipep's house. ``Here is your place'', and he showed it to her. Then Bipep said to White Ant, a friendly spirit: ``You should deceive the bush spirit.'' ``Yes, I will do that.'' White Ant remained in the bush spirit's cave, and Bipep closed the door behind Muem as White Ant is called: ``We are leaving. You will stay here to wait for the spirit.'' ``Yes, you two go now.'' The bush spirit came back and brought the \textit{aibika}-leaves home: ``Are you there?'' ``Yes, I am here,'' replied Muem, the White Ant. The bush spirit went into its room, took the stone axe and brought it, ``Now I will break White Ant into pieces, it deceived me. Oh, the woman! Oh no, she has gone.'' The bush spirit followed their traces: ``Oh, here he went together with her. They went to Bipep's house.'' Arriving there he asked Bipep: ``Are you in?'' ``No, we are not.'' ``You are lying, it's the two of you.'' Bipep insisted: ``No, it's not us.'' The bush spirit countered, ``You deceive me. I have seen her, she is here.'' The bush spirit went up the ladder to Bipep's house. Two dogs bit it. It fell on the ground, but stood up again. ``I was sleeping,'' the spirit thought. Then it said to Bipep: ``I'll leave, I go back to my house.'' It turned back and went.}
