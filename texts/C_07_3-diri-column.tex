The younger brother was staying with the older brother's wife at the bush camp. His older brother went off into the bush. When leaving for the deep bush the older brother took dogs with him into the bush. No, there were no dogs. He didn't take any dogs. He went alone. There were no dogs. Looking up he had seen tree kangaroos, two of them. Then, having come back to the camp, he said to his younger brother: ``I have seen tree kangaroos. Come, let us go!

The older brother thought: ``My younger brother is a human being. But now his body looks like that of a dog. He became dog-like.'' The older brother climbed high up after the kangaroos. There he pushed them down from the tree by shooting arrows at them. The younger brother ran here. His skin had changed. He had become a dog. The older brother had climbed high up after the tree kangaroos. The two tree kangaroos must have jumped onto another branch. The younger brother had become dog-like. So he could grab the two tree kangaroos and killed them. The two tree kangaroos jumped and fell on the ground. He killed them both, a male one und a female one. He caught the two tree kangaroos. The younger brother was still a dog.}
