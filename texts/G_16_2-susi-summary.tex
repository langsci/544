For the Kilmeri people, freshwater turtles are part of their diet. However, it seems that not many turtles are left in the streams and waterholes. Only every now and then someone catches one. Since the animals are quite small, the quantity of meat is also quite small. In fact, it is only the limbs and the neck with the head that provide meat. When a turtle is caught, it is hung upside down on a fishing line until it dies. This took place in Rose Osi's kitchen house.
