Margaret comments on the beautiful plumage of the crowned pigeon (\textit{Goura victoria}), which is endemic to northern New Guinea. Crowned pigeons used to be common in the forests of the Kilmeri region. They are large and beautiful birds. They were and still are hunted for their meat and their feathers. A crowned pigeon can provide almost twice as much meat as a chicken. Margaret once told me that one of her relatives shot one. She thought it was a good catch because it was a good meal and because it brought back her memories of the past.

In the following text, Margaret took the opportunity to talk about the appearance, beauty, and also the delicious meat of ground pigeons.
