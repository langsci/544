The forest in the Kilmeri region is the habitat of wild boars. On the one hand, they are prized for hunting. On the other hand, they are invaders in the gardens of humans. At times it is hard to keep them out. At worst, they can destroy an entire taro patch. In order to prevent this, one must make regular visits to the gardens and light fires. Pigs are quite shy and avoid human presence. In her description of the pigs' behaviour, Margaret's mention of a sorcerer seems unmotivated. Sorcerers attack humans, but not animals or plants.
