Every garden has a patch of bananas. People usually plant not just one variety, but different types of banana. They always had bananas for cooking and some sweet bananas for eating. There is often a further banana patch right next to the house. I once helped Margaret plant banana sprouts, which she recalls here. (See also \cite{Gerstner-Link:0vc}, for the different types of \textit{Musa} that are known and cultivated by the Kilmeri).
