    \ParallelRText{The darkness of the rainy weather is pervasive. There is a heavy rain. It is windy. Wind comes in, a storm. It breaks down a branch of the mango tree opposite our house. The rain is coming in blowing. Wind and rain come together. The wind is shaking heavily the leaf ribs of the papaya tree. The rain is approaching and then turning away in another direction.}
