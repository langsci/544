    \ParallelRText{This is Am's story. They celebrated a traditional ceremony. After the ceremony there was money and stone axes. The ceremony brought money and stone axes. Am played the guitar. He took the money and put it in the bag. When the people grabbed the axes, all the blades broke. They shared them. Bu gave them to the people; he gave them three. Then Am built a house. He erected one tall post supporting a platform. The people lived there. The women Paeni, Yob, Baepiye, and Sin cooked the food and took care of the children. When mothers were giving birth, the umbilical cords of the boys fell. The girls were not fetched from their mothers; the boys only were fetched to the \textit{haus tambaran}. They accompanied them to the house, the house of parliament Siopo. The name of the house is Parliament House or Siopo House. The house disappeared. It was transferred to Port Moresby. It is now in Port Moresby. The trees Ipor and Dawar were like Bu's phone when he was hunting, when he roamed about in the bush. Bu said, ``Pigs live here,'' and the people built hunting fences and shot the pigs from there. ``Possums live here,'' that's what Bu was saying. ``Bandicoots live here'' and ``Boars live here.'' He caught them when he roamed around in the bush.}
