    \ParallelRText{I am taking the washed things again, carry them down outside again, and hang them on the other clothes line, which is outside the house. Then I climb up the stairs into the house and sit there again. Oh, it may rain now! Again I climb down, go take the laundry, carry them up here into the house, hang them on the indoor line, and sit down again. Suddenly it seems to get sunny. Again I carry the things down and hang them. Again I come up here into the house and sit down to rest. Oh, now it is raining! The sun doesn't shine any longer. I go again to take the clothes and carry them up here. It rains. I'll sleep.}
