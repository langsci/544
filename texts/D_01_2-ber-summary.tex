Until at least 1961, the year the Ossima Mission was founded, and possibly much longer, men covered their penises with a decorated gourd. According to what Margaret Osi told me, the men used small egg-shaped gourds for this purpose. This type of phallocrypt is widespread in the Sepik, the Border Mountains and the Bewani Mountains. Some specimens are now part of the anthropological collections of museums in Berlin, Leiden, Paris, and Adelaide. They were found in many settlements and language groups. It is interesting to mention a specimen found in Kilifas in the Fas/Momu language area.\footnote{See the photo on the website ``Upper Sepik-Central New Guinea Project,'' Data Set, Language Fas, Village Fas 2, Title Gourd phallocrypt, Image No.1: \url{https://data.uscngp.com/artifact-images/7/VI\%2050037/1.jpg}} The depicted carved decoration looks similar to those described by Margaret Osi and worn by her husband Lis Osi and her father Apai.
