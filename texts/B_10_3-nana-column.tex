    \ParallelRText{Wau dropped a small knife into the river. The knife fell into the river. The small knife sank down and landed on a man's breast, on the breast of an old man. The old man took the knife in his hand, another man's knife. Meanwhile Wau went back to the village where he is asked about the knife. ``Wau, what about the small knife? Where is it?'' ``The small knife fell into the river.'' ``You hurry up again and go to get it!''}

    \ParallelRText{``What am I going to do now because of this?'' thinks Wau. The river was deep and he pondered. He went away. He cut a liana of wild limbum. A long liana, a very long one.  Having cut it, he took it to the river and threw it into the water. ``Oh, well, now I can go right down.'' The other end of the rope was tightened vertically above the water, there it starts. Then Wau went down, further down, further down, further down. His hand touched his ear. There is the magic blood of a corpse. He went on. While he was gliding through the water, he spit the blood out in order to make the water opaque so that he cannot be seen. He became aware of the old man. He arrived at his place. ``Ah, why did you come?'' ``Ah, I am looking for the small knife.'' ``The small knife, I took it, yes. Here it is, the small knife, look. Hurry up again! The people went to work, yet they will soon return. Hurry up! They will kill you, hurry up, hurry up! Go up quickly, otherwise they will kill you by cutting the rope.''}

    \ParallelRText{The old man gave Wau a firestick. Wau is going up with the fire. With a glowing piece of firewood only, the flame has extinguished. He is going up again, going up, going up. He reaches the river bank, arrives there and rested. The end of the tree was creaking, ``Oh, Wau is coming up right here,'' says a companion who stood near the river. Wau stood there for a while. Then he went back to the house and people asked him: ``Wau, you have got the small knife?'' ``I have got it. Look, the small knife, here it is again.''}
