    \ParallelRText{The male cult house of highest rank we did not see. But we saw the second ranking cult house, the Saul Bopule Iwan house we saw. In the presence of this cult house food was abundant; we jointly ate enough, even generously. Food stayed with us, the variety given by the culthouse's rituals was plentiful. We were born, and food like this was always around. There used to always be something to eat, always.}

When they had settled down, they proclaimed the word of God to us, and we heard it ourselves. Before we didn't know the word of God. We lived, we simply lived. Having accepted the word of God, yes, we had knowledge of a good word. Before we didn't have the word of God, we were just living.}

Fish were spreading in all creeks, sago grubs were cultivated at many places. We could always eat more than enough. Nowadays, there is but one piece of food available. No abundance. When hungry we have just one bit of food. Occasionally, there was complete lack of food everywhere.}
