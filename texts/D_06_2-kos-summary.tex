Margaret Osi comments on her granddaughter Imelda, who is sitting in an oil palm directly opposite the window of my house. Making brooms from palm material is still very common. Imelda cuts the palm fronds as raw material for the broom. The outer layer with the leaves has to be scraped off. Then the inner, tendon-like strips remain, which are tied together. The broom is then ready for use.
