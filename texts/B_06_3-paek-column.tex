When they had cooked and eaten their food with some meat, father and son were sitting alone. After the meal they went to bed.

At night the bush spirit came up from the bottom of the pond again. At night the father's hand touched his knee. While he's touching his knee, the dangerous pond lurks nearby. Having come up at night, the bush spirit swallowed up the child's father. Only the father it swallowed up. It broke his bed completely. It gulped him and broke the bed. It didn't swallow the child, and the boy was still alive. He got up in a bad mood, because the bush spirit devoured his father. After the human night meal, the bush spirit went down into the water again. The boy ran away and then was sitting between the buttresses of a tree until early morning. Then he searched for his father: ``A python, no.'' The boy is pondering: ``A bush spirit must have swallowed up my father, not a python. This was a man, a bush spirit swallowed him up.''}
